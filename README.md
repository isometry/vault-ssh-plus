# vault-ssh-plus (vssh)

An enhanced implementation of [`vault ssh`](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/ssh), wrapping the OpenSSH `ssh` client to eliminate the management overhead of using of short-lived SSH client keys CA-signed by [@hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).

## Features

* Support for all [`ssh(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1) capabilities, including:
  * non-filesystem private keys (e.g. `gpg-agent`, PKCS#11, etc.);
  * arbitrary [`ssh_config(5)`](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config.5) configuration (e.g. `Host` aliases and `Match` clauses);
  * `ControlMaster` connection sharing.
* Automatic and transparent just-in-time delivery of short-lived, CA-signed, single-use `ssh` client keys.
* Adherence to the Principal of Least Privilege: by default, signed keys only permit the specific extensions required for the `ssh` options given.
* Automatic username mapping for Vault roles with a single, fixed entry in `allowed_users` (e.g. `root`, `jenkins`, `ansible`).
* Significantly lower memory overhead than `vault ssh`.

## Requirements

* A [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) instance configured for [SSH Client Key Signing](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates.html#client-key-signing), access to an appropriate role, and an SSH server configured to trust the Vault CA.
* An active Vault token (either in the `VAULT_TOKEN` environment variable, or – if the standard `vault` binary is available within `$PATH` – available from a Vault Token Helper). The `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable must also be set.
* OpenSSH 7.2 or newer `ssh` client binary.

If you need to override the [SSH Client Key Signing](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-certificates.html#client-key-signing) mountpoint or role, this is most easily achieved by setting the `VAULT_SSH_PATH` and `VAULT_SSH_ROLE` environment variables in your shell rc.
If your Vault SSH mountpoint isn't configured with a role matching the target SSH username, you *will* need to specify the Vault SSH role to use (e.g. `export VAULT_SSH_ROLE=self` or `vssh --role=self host` if you're using a role named `self` configured with templated `allowed_users`).

In `issue` mode (the default), the client will retrieve an ephemeral keypair from Vault, exposed to `ssh(1)` via an internal SSH agent.

In `sign` mode, the client will sign the public key specified, defaulting to the first key added into `ssh-agent(1)` (preferring the first of type matching `VAULT_SSH_KEY_TYPE`).

The certificate will be requested with only those extensions required for the current command (default `permit-pty` unless `-N` is specified). Additional extensions may be requested (e.g. to support expected future multiplexed connections) with the "Certificate Extensions" arguments, or the Vault role default extensions may be forced with `--default-extensions`.

### Examples

The following will request that an existing ed25519 public key be signed by the Vault signer at `https://vault.example.com:8200/v1/ssh-client-signer/sign/default`, with (automatic) `permit-pty` and `permit-port-forwarding` extensions to support the connection to `host.example.com`:

```console
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.example.com:8200
$ export VAULT_SSH_PATH=ssh-client-signer
$ export VAULT_SSH_ROLE=default
$ export VAULT_SSH_MODE=sign
$ vault login
...
$ vssh -L8080:localhost:80 host.example.com
...
```

The following will request that an ephemeral ecdsa keypair with a (default) 256-bit private key be generated by the Vault issuer at `https://vault.example.com/v1/ssh/issue/root`, and used to run the `id` command on `host2.example.com` as `root`:

```console
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.example.com
$ export VAULT_SSH_KEY_TYPE=ec
$ vault login
...
$ vssh root@host2.example.com id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),5(operator)
```
